This is the source code for Joonyone NFT project's webpage. 

Joonyone is my first NFT art project with 9 selected artworks I drew back from my high school years. 

[Written in Solidity](https://github.com/itsyeonjoon/joonyone_contract_baobab), the artworks are created and stored on the Klaytn blockchain. There are several small merits of purchasing Joonyone NFT in addition to having ownership of my artwork, like having being on the whitelist for my next NFT projects or maybe having a coffee together with me whenever you visit Seattle.
